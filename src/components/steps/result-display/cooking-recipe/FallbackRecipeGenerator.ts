Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Slowly add water while mixing until a soft dough forms.

2. Knead the dough gently for 5-7 minutes, thinking of ${memory}. Let rest for 20 minutes.

3. Roll dough into small circles. Place a spoonful of your heart's filling in the center of each.

4. Fold and seal edges carefully, as if protecting the memory itself.

5. Cook using ${cookingStyle} for 12-15 minutes until they float with the lightness of remembrance.

6. Serve warm, allowing each bite to transport you back to that special moment.

Cooking Notes:
- Handle with care, as these dumplings carry more than just flavor
- Best enjoyed while sharing stories of the memory that inspired them
- The aroma alone should evoke the essence of ${memory}`;
